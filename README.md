Exercise Tracker is the 4th project for FreeCodeCamp *Back End Development and APIs* course. It uses **MongoDB** to save the users and their exercise
information into a database. This data can then be retrieved and processed into logs.

Here is an example of a use case:
> A user sends a POST request with a username. The server saves the user data and gives an ID that is required for creating exercise data entries
> and linking them to the user The user uses the ID and starts sending POST requests containing the exercise data. They get an overview of all of
> their exercise data with a GET request to their logs.

Everything **not** written by me has been cloned from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-exercisetracker/).

The default README that comes with the cloned repository:
> This is the boilerplate for the Exercise Tracker project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker

**NOTE!** As this project is significantly larger than the previous ones, I will not paste my solution into this README file.
